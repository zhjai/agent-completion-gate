# Changelog

## v0.4.2

- **Fix: `goal-compile` was being silently dropped at install** — its `description` was 1072 chars, over the Agent Skills 1024-char limit, so hosts skipped the skill ("Skipped loading 1 skill(s) … exceeds maximum length of 1024 characters"). Trimmed to 784 chars (kept the triggers, the small-task exclusions, and the no-self-certify rule; cut the verbose process prose). Audited all skills in the repo against the spec limits (name ≤64 + format, description ≤1024) — all pass.

## v0.4.1

- **`goal-compile` now right-sizes — small tasks skip the gate.** Two fixes from real-use feedback (settled in agent-arena):
  - **Broader, prefix-free triggering:** natural phrasings fire it too — "帮我完成这个任务/目标", "help me build/implement X", "做一个 X" — not just "设计goal:"/"goal:". No magic word required.
  - **Right-size step 0 (before any ceremony):** the skill now classifies the task first. A typo / one-line / single-function / one-off request is handled **directly with no init, no criteria, no confirmation** (at most a one-line "say 'use the gate' if you want criteria"). The init + confirm + gate ceremony only runs for substantial work (multi-step / multi-file / user-visible artifact). When unsure it defaults to small. Bias: under-fire (recoverable with "use the gate") over over-fire (ceremony on trivial work erodes trust). The gate is per-goal, not per-utterance — sub-steps inside a goal don't re-trigger it.

## v0.4.0

- **Goal-first lazy mode** — new [`goal-compile`](skills/goal-compile/SKILL.md) skill. The user just states a goal in natural language ("设计goal: …", "goal: add a monthly sales report page", "我的目标是…" — no fixed prefix; the skill auto-triggers on intent). It auto-initializes the gate if absent, compiles the goal into acceptance criteria (surfaces + machine checks + review items), **confirms the criteria with the user once, in plain language, before doing the work** (like confirming a plan — no hand-written YAML), then executes and runs the gate. Cuts the old skill→clone→init→hand-write-YAML friction to one sentence + one confirmation.
  - **Trust boundary preserved (the whole point):** the agent only *drafts* criteria and *proposes*; a human confirms them and only the external gate grants `complete`. It never self-certifies. Confirm-before-work (not after) so criteria can't be biased toward whatever was already built. Where CI/CODEOWNERS own the specs, the agent can only propose a diff (stays `needs_criteria_approval` until merged).
  - **Lite mode** (only if the user explicitly opts out of confirming): self-check against the agent's own drafted criteria, reported as **`SELF-CHECK-OK`** — explicitly **not** a verified completion, never `COMPLETE-OK`.
- README leads with this as the recommended path; manual setup kept below for those who want to wire it themselves.
- Fixed the GitHub About/topics that still said "Built on agent-memory" — the gate is standalone (decoupled in v0.3.1).

## v0.3.1

- **Onboarding overhaul** (so a normal developer gets it, OpenSpec-style):
  - `scripts/init.sh` — a deterministic, idempotent scaffolder you run yourself: drops `gate/` (engine + empty manifest), `control/`, `state/`, the CI workflow, and a CODEOWNERS example into your project, then prints exactly what *you* must protect. No more manual `cp`. The new `completion-gate-init` skill is a thin wrapper around it (the script is the authority — the agent never becomes the trust root of its own gate).
  - `examples/minimal-project/` — an everyday "add a monthly sales report page" walkthrough (before → BLOCKED on a 1-point chart + missing CSV export; after → COMPLETE-OK). Replaces the ML/SwanLab story on the first screen; SwanLab stays as the deeper real-incident fixture.
  - **README rewritten, problem-first**: leads with goal-driven agents missing user-visible acceptance details ("the goal is not the acceptance criteria"), an honesty note that a *human* writes the checks (the gate infers nothing), and one positioning line vs OpenSpec. Mechanism / state-machine / invariants moved below the fold. The demo is now "See it in action"; the quick start scaffolds into *your* repo. EN + idiomatic 中文.
- **Fully decoupled from `agent-lessonbook` (formerly agent-memory).** The gate is standalone: it never reads any memory/lesson path at runtime (only `--manifest`/`--inventory`/`--candidate`/`--repo`), no longer says "depends on / built on / install first", and dropped the memory skills from `completion-audit`'s `related_skills`. Invariant #1 no longer references a "lesson-promotion path" (an external concept) — the gate is protected simply because it's outside the agent-writable workspace and human/CI-maintained. A lesson becomes gate policy only when a human edits the protected manifest.
- **Onboarding fixes** (heterogeneous review, reproduced then fixed): `init.sh` no longer silently overwrites engine scripts on re-run (so a user's `run_machine_check()` extensions survive; `--force` to refresh); the `completion-gate-init` skill + README quick-start now give a resolvable command (clone the repo, run `scripts/init.sh` from the checkout) instead of a non-existent skill-dir path; fixed a duplicated section in the Chinese README.

## v0.3.0

- **Diff-derived touched surfaces** — close the `touched_surfaces` self-report gap (a worker could omit a surface it touched):
  - `gate/derive_touched.py` maps changed files to surfaces via per-surface `paths` globs in the inventory, from a changed-file list or `git diff BASE...HEAD`.
  - `check_acceptance.py --touched IDS` accepts a TRUSTED touched set (precedence: `--strict-surfaces` > `--touched` > worker self-report).
  - `verify_completion.sh --diff-base REF` derives the set from git and passes it through; `--touched IDS` for a precomputed set.
  - `surface_inventory.yaml` gains optional `paths` globs; `examples/diff_demo.sh` shows a worker under-reporting `exports` getting caught (default GRANTS, diff-derived BLOCKS).
  - Hardened (bypasses found + reproduced in agent-arena review, then closed): `derive_touched.py` uses `git diff --no-renames --name-only -z` — a rename out of a surface's path no longer hides it (old path is kept), and special-char/newline paths stay raw instead of being git-quoted past the globs (and non-UTF-8 paths round-trip via `surrogateescape` instead of crashing). `examples/diff_rename_test.sh` is a runnable regression for both.
- **Productionization** (external review: the repo was a concept kit; these make it usable out of the box):
  - **Defaults no longer brick.** The shipped `gate/acceptance_manifest.yaml` + `control/surface_inventory.yaml` are now EMPTY, passable templates (you opt into strictness). The realistic SwanLab spec moved to `examples/swanlab/`. Previously the default inventory + manifest + `--strict-surfaces` could never reach `complete`.
  - **Bug:** `review_queue` as a list of strings no longer crashes (`AttributeError`); both dict and string review items are handled.
  - **New:** `check_acceptance.py --agent-writable-root DIR` fails closed if a protected spec is reachable inside the worker-writable workspace — it checks the **literal** path too, so a symlink placed in the root but pointing outside can't bypass it (a bypass found + reproduced in review). Makes invariant #1 enforceable at runtime, not just documented.
  - `examples/swanlab/` uses `.json` (the loader never truly supported JSONC).
  - **Self-CI + tests:** `tests/test_gate.py` (12 cases incl. overstep, missing/non-mapping/conflicting candidate, string `review_queue`, `--strict-surfaces`, `--touched`, `--agent-writable-root`, and import-shadow resistance) + `.github/workflows/test.yml` (compile + tests + all example scripts).
  - **README rewritten** for a first-time reader: plain "what is this", a 60-second quick start, "use it in your project" steps, and what the agent does after installing the skill — concepts moved below. English + 中文.

## v0.2.0

- **Shipped enforcement wiring** (`integrations/`) so "only an external verifier writes `complete`" is true out of the box, not left to the reader:
  - `gate/verify_completion.sh` — the external verifier: rejects a worker that wrote `complete` itself, requires `candidate_complete`, runs the gate against real artifacts, and grants `complete` only on a clean pass. Its exit code is the one canonical signal.
  - `integrations/github-actions/completion-gate.yml` — CI required check (the **authority**: runs outside the worker's control, gates the merge; hermetic, pinned Python; optional `STRICT` mode).
  - `integrations/claude-code/` — Claude Code Stop hook (`exit 2` blocks "done" and feeds the gate's reasons back to the agent); doubles as a Codex completion hook.
  - `integrations/git-hooks/pre-push` — local fast-feedback hook (bypassable by design; optional `HARD_BLOCK`).
  - `examples/run.sh` now exercises the verifier end to end (overstep → blocked, blocked, granted) against the bundled fixtures.
- **Hardened against a heterogeneous red-team pass** (bypasses found by Codex, each reproduced then closed, then re-verified):
  - The state-machine guard moved **into the protected `check_acceptance.py`** (no shell-side parser to shadow). Status is read strictly — scalar only, no `status or state` truthiness fallback, conflicting `status`/`state` rejected, non-mapping candidate rejected.
  - The gate is invoked with **`python3 -E`** (and as a file, not via `python -`), so a worker-planted `yaml.py` or `PYTHON*` env can no longer shadow `import yaml` to fake the verdict (invariant #6 — which this kit had warned about and then violated).
  - **`--strict-surfaces`** requires every user-visible surface to have a passing check, so "unknowns fail closed" no longer trusts the worker's self-reported `touched_surfaces`.
  - CI template now **fail-closes on an absent candidate** by default (`ALLOW_NO_CANDIDATE` to opt out) and runs `gate/`+`control/` from the **base branch**, so a PR can't be judged by a gate it edits.
  - Docs corrected to stop overclaiming hermeticity / unbypassability — stated as "external + fail-closed under a trusted base branch + runner".
- **Docs:** added a banner (`assets/banner.svg`), a Chinese `README.zh.md`, and broadened positioning to any Agent-Skills host (Claude Code · Codex · others). Corrected the dependency boundary — the gate **bundles** its own protected check spec (`acceptance_manifest.yaml` + `control/surface_inventory.yaml`) and is self-contained. *(Earlier in v0.3.x this section described reading `agent-memory`'s `control/`; that coupling was removed — see the decoupling note above.)*

## v0.1.0

> Historical snapshot of v0.1.0 behavior. Superseded by v0.3.1: the gate is now **fully standalone** and does **not** depend on / read `agent-memory` (now [`agent-lessonbook`](https://github.com/zhjai/agent-lessonbook)) at runtime. Invariant #1 below mentions a "lesson-promotion path" — that concept was dropped; the gate is protected simply by being outside the agent-writable workspace.

- Initial preview of `agent-completion-gate`: a **fail-closed completion gate + four-state machine** that stops a goal-driven agent from declaring work done that isn't.
- State machine: `in_progress → candidate_complete → (external verifier) → complete | blocked`. The worker can only reach `candidate_complete` or `blocked`; only an external verifier writes `complete`. **`needs-review == blocked`** (not an annotation).
- Six non-negotiable invariants, each closing a bypass found in heterogeneous review:
  1. protected gate/manifest/inventory (outside the agent-writable workspace AND outside the lesson-promotion path);
  2. inspect real artifacts, never `run_state`;
  3. unknowns fail closed;
  4. one canonical completion signal (chat/PR/dashboard derive from it);
  5. artifact content is hostile data, not instructions (deterministic checks first; LLM verifier treats artifacts as untrusted);
  6. hermetic execution (pin env).
- **Depends on [`agent-memory`](https://github.com/zhjai/agent-memory)**: reads its read-only `control/` (rules + `surface_inventory`) as the check spec; never trusts the worker-writable `state/`.
- Designed and hardened across multiple agent-arena rounds (Claude × Codex) — including a round where Codex itself invoked Claude as a red-team sub-agent, which caught the self-policing and verifier-injection holes.
